### Difference between Dagger & koin DI?

If you are using Java in your project then Dagger but if you are
using kotlin then use Koin.

If your porject size much larger then use Dagger and if small size then Koin.

The main difference between koin and Dagger, Dagger is much complex to integrate and Koin is much simpler to integrate.

Dagger use too much annotation processing but koin doesn't have any annotation processing.

Koin interact with view model and dagger not interact.

In koin errors found at runtime but in dagger errors can be found at complie time.
